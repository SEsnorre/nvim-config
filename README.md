# Personal NeoVim configuration using Lazy.vim

I'm switching to NeoVim because I want to have a more productive and lightwheight development environment under my hands. Switching between keyboard and mouses is kind of anoying and I want to use my mouse as little as possible.

> Why wasting time switching between Input devices?

This was my original question and I have seen a lot of great Videos on that Topic.
Here I want to thank the youtuber (not sponsored or something else) **[typecraft]{https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev}** for his amazing videos thath got me into this and thath helped me start and configure Neovim.

## What is in this config?

This configuration is a based on [lazy.nvim]{https://www.lazy.folke.io} and currently consists of the following plugins:

- **monokai-pro** - my preffered color scheme (yes, it is not *catpuccin*)
- **neotree** - revealing the filesystem on the side
- **telescope** - for live grep and fzf
- **treesitter** - indentation and highliting of code

For the detailed configuration lookup the [init.lua]{./init.lua} file. It also contains some keybind configurations.

I will also make a [cheat sheet]{./cheatsheet.md} with important commands that I use in NeoVim. ***This is still work in progress!***
